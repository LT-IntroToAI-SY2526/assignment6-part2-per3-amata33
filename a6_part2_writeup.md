## Question 1: Feature Importance

Based on your house price model, rank the four features from most important to least important. Explain how you determined this ranking.

**YOUR ANSWER:**
1. Most Important: Square Feet
2. Age
3. Bedrooms
4. Least Important: Bathrooms

**Explanation:**
There is a strong positive relationship among squarefeet and price. If the house is bigger then the house increases, simple yet important

It is not strong at all, however, looking at the graph there is a pattern of the dots going downhill, showing that while the house is older, the price will be lower. This can be of course because of maintainance of the house itself.

There is not a relationship with bedrooms with price and bathrooms with price. They are very similar however. The reason I put bathrooms as least important is because it has less "lines" in the graph. This is because most houses have an average of 2 bathrooms. Bedrooms however depend on the size of the house, which can drastically increase prices because of the amount of goods the house has to offer.

Those two are ultimately at the bottom because they are both inside the area of the house, which we can see that if it increases then the price does too with it. SquareFeet vs Price basically explains the other 3 graphs.
